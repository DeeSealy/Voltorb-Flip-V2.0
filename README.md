# Voltorb-Flip-V2.0

Changes from 1.0:

-Fully rebuilt from the ground-up

-Able to check victory



This Voltorb Flip is a C#-based version of a popular mini-game featured in the Nintendo game Pokemon HeartGold/SoulSilver. 

It is my very first major solo programming project that I decided to redo with OOP principles.
